# Role Based Application Access Package 

## Overview 

This use case outlines the process for a company to create access packages for specific applications based on user teams using Microsoft Entra ID Governance. The goal is to streamline access management by automating the assignment of access packages based on user attributes, ensuring that users have the right access at the right time. 

## Detailed Use Case 

### Scenario: 
A company wants to streamline the process of granting access to specific applications for different user teams. The company has various teams, each requiring access to different sets of applications, groups, and resources. The current manual process is time-consuming and prone to errors. The company aims to automate this process using Microsoft Entra ID Governance to create access packages that bundle the necessary resources for each team. 

### Requirements: 

Automated Access Management: Automate the assignment of access packages based on user attributes such as department, role, and location. 

Enhanced Security: Ensure that users have the appropriate access based on their roles and responsibilities, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access. 

Streamlined Processes: Simplify the process of managing access to multiple resources, making it easier for administrators to handle access requests and reviews. 

Regular Access Reviews: Implement a process to regularly review and remove access when a user's job role changes or they leave the organization.
